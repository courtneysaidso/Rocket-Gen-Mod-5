## Relational Databases vs Document Databases

Relational databases organize data into structured tables with rows and column, creating a predefined schema. They are best for handling complex queries and relationships between data entities. Document databases, on the other hand, store data in flexible, JSON-like documents. They allow for schema flexibility, making them suitable for semi-structured or unstructured data.
